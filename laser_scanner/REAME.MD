## Basic Idea
The solution for this exercise can be easily described as follow :
- for the assumption that **K** (# of clusters) is known, we used **kmeans** algorithm of the OpenCv library.
- for the assumption that **K** is known, we still used the **kmeans** algorithm but, but we selected the best value of **K** depending on the **silhouette coefficent** and, in particular the range of values between [2, 29]. The reason of the value 29 is the following :
    - **3.5 meters** is the **maximum range** of the **laser**.
    - a single **person** roughly **occupies** **0.75 meters**.
    - a person has 2 legs.
    - the **angle covered** by the sensor is **2 * pi** radiants i.e. **360Â°** .
    - the **maximum** number of **persons** that lies in a **circumference**  is given by the formula : 
    
        *(2 * pi * radius_circumference) / (legs_of_persons * space_occupied_averagely_by_a_person)*
        
        And, with the data above we obtain :

        *(2 * pi * 3.5) / (2 * 0.75) ~ 29.*

## Installation instructions 
In order to **execute** the code inside the package you must follow these steps :
- **download** the **vision_opencv** ROS package i.e. :
    - go inside the the `src` folder of the **workspace** where you want to put this downloaded package i.e. `cd <workspace_path>/src/` .
    - clone the following repository inside of it : https://github.com/ros-perception/vision_opencv i.e : 
    
        `git clone https://github.com/ros-perception/vision_opencv`.
    - move inside the cloned repository i.e. `cd <workspace_path>/src/vision_opencv/`
    - change **branch** to **melodic** i.e. `git checkout melodic`.
- **execute** `catkin build` command.
- **execute**
    - `source devel/setup.bash` and either :
        - `rosrun laser_scanner solution_k_known` : for executing the solution with the hypotesis that **K** is **known**.
        - `rosrun laser_scanner solution_k_not_known` : for executing the solution with the hypotesis that **K** is **not known**.
