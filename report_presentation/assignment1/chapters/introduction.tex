\section{Introduction}
In this report we are going to explain the main details of how our solution for this assignment works. In particular we are going to explain:
\begin{itemize}
    \item  the code structure of our solution.
    \item  how we have solved the problem of obstacles detection, which includes walls detection and circular movable obstacles detection that are both comprises in the environment.
    \item how we have solved the problem of the navigation through the narrow corridor using the laser data.
